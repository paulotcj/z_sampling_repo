In this part of the repository you can find my attempts to solve LeetCode problems.
Many problems have extensive comments added as I tried to keep track of my tought process
  and facilitate future reviews.
I never expected to showcase these solutions to anyone, so code can be taken more as my
  personal notes trying to solve these problems - and that also reflect the lack of actual
  use of any sort of framework for testing - it was just quick prototyping.
