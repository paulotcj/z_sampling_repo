In this part of the repository, you can find my attempts to solve LeetCode problems. 
Many problems have extensive comments added, as I tried to keep track of my thought 
  process and facilitate future reviews. 
I never expected to showcase these solutions to anyone, so the code can be taken 
  more as my personal notes while trying to solve these problems â€” which also 
  explains the lack of any framework for testing - it was just quick prototyping.


If you want to check something, I would recommend: 
    042_Arrays_trapping_rain_water/4_trapping_rain_water.py 
And perhaps something more recent, where I started to use type hinting more 
  consistently: 
    200_2D_Arrays_Number_of_Islands/1_Number_of_Islands_DFS
