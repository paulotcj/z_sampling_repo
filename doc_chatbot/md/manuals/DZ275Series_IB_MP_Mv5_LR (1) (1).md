even, crisp results. Use the crisper plate when you want food to come out crispy. The plate elevates the food in the
basket so that air can flow under and around it to cook ingredients evenly.
 W hy didnt my food cook fully?
Make sure the basket is fully inserted during cooking. For consistent browning, make sure ingredients
are arranged in an even layer on the bottom of the basket with no overlapping. Shake basket to
toss ingredients for even crispiness. Cook temperature and time can be adjusted at any time during
cooking. Simply use the TEMP arrows to adjust the temperature or the TIME arrows to adjust the time.
 W hy is my food burned?
For best results, check progress throughout cooking and remove food when desired level of
brownness has been achieved. Remove food immediately after the cook time ends to avoid
overcooking.
 W hy do some ingredients blow around when air frying?
Occasionally, the fan from the air fryer will blow lightweight foods around. Use wooden toothpicks to
secure loose lightweight food, like the top slice of bread on a sandwich.
 C an I air fry wet, battered ingredients?
Yes, but use the proper breading technique. It is important to coat foods first with flour, then with
egg, and then with bread crumbs. Press breading firmly onto the battered ingredients, so crumbs
wont be blown off by the fan.
 W hy did the display screen go black?
The unit is in standby mode. Press the power button to turn it back on.
 W hy is the unit beeping?
Either the food is done cooking, or the other zone has started cooking.
 W hy is there an E message on the display screen?
The unit is not functioning properly. Please contact Customer Service at 1-877-646-5288.
 W hy did a circuit breaker trip while using the unit?
The unit uses 1690 watts of power, so it must be plugged into an outlet on a 15-amp circuit breaker.
Using an outlet on a 10-amp breaker will cause the breaker to trip. It is also important that the unit
be the only appliance plugged into an outlet when in use. To avoid tripping a breaker, make sure the
unit is the only appliance plugged into an outlet on a 15-amp breaker
